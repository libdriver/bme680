## LibDriver BME680

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/bme680/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The BME680 is an integrated environmental sensor designed for mobile applications and wearables, where size and low power consumption are crucial. It expands Bosch Sensortec's existing family of environmental sensors by integrating high linearity and high accuracy sensors for gas, pressure, humidity, and temperature for the first time.

LibDriver BME680 is a full-featured driver for BME680, launched by LibDriver.It provides pressure reading, temperature reading, humidity reading, gas reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver BME680 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver BME680 IIC, SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver BME680 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver BME680 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver BME680 offline document.

/datasheet includes BME680 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC, SPI platform independent template and finish your platform IIC, SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_bme680_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature_c;
float pressure_pa;
float humidity_percentage;

/* basic init */
res = bme680_basic_init(BME680_INTERFACE_IIC, BME680_ADDRESS_ADO_LOW);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    bme680_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = bme680_basic_read((float *)&temperature_c, (float *)&pressure_pa, (float *)&humidity_percentage);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bme680_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature_c);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: pressure is %0.2fPa.\n", pressure_pa);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity_percentage);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)bme680_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example gas

```C
#include "driver_bme680_gas.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature_c;
float pressure_pa;
float humidity_percentage;
float ohms;
uint8_t index = 0;
float idac_ma = 5.0f;
float degree_celsius = 200.0f;
uint16_t gas_wait_ms = 150;

/* gas init */
res = bme680_gas_init(BME680_INTERFACE_IIC, BME680_ADDRESS_ADO_LOW);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    bme680_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = bme680_gas_read(idac_ma, degree_celsius, gas_wait_ms, index,
                         (float *)&temperature_c, (float *)&pressure_pa, (float *)&humidity_percentage, (float *)&ohms);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)bme680_gas_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: %d/%d.\n", i + 1, 3);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature_c);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: pressure is %0.2fPa.\n", pressure_pa);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity_percentage);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: gas index is %d.\n", index);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: idac is %0.2fmA.\n", idac_ma);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: degree celsius is %0.1fC.\n", degree_celsius);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: gas wait is %d ms.\n", gas_wait_ms);
    bme680_interface_debug_print("bme680: gas resistance is %0.2fohms.\n", ohms);
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)bme680_gas_deinit();

return 0;
```
